Here was a trio of old ladies crossing Main Street from the New England Bank side to the
Shoeboat side. They heard the harsh burr of the playing cards and looked up. Their mouths
dropped open as a boy on a huge bike passed within half a foot of them like a mirage.
 The worst — and the best — of the trip was behind him now. He had looked at the very
real possibility of his own death again and again had found himself able to look away. The
bus had not crushed him; he had not killed himself and the three old ladies with their Freese's
shopping bags and their Social Security checks; he had not been splattered across the tailgate
of Uncle Ike's old Dodge pick-up. He was going uphill again now, speed bleeding away.
Something — oh, call it desire, that was good enough, wasn't it? — was bleeding away with
it. All the thoughts and memories were catching up — in Bill, gee, we almost lost sight of
you for awhile there, but here we are — rejoining him, climbing up his shirt and jumping into
his ear and whooshing into his brain like little kids going down a slide. He could feel them
settling into their accustomed places, their feverish bodies jostling each other. Gosh! Wow!
Here we are inside Bill's head again! Let's think about George! Okay! Who wants to start?
 You think too much, Bill.
